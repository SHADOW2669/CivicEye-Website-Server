## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of the Civic Eye Website Server is important. We appreciate any effort to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them privately. This gives us time to address the issue before it becomes public knowledge.

You can report a vulnerability in one of two ways:

 **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting:** Use the [private vulnerability reporting feature on GitHub](https://github.com/SHADOW2669/CivicEye-Website-Server/security/advisories/new). This is the most secure and preferred method.


### What to Include in Your Report

To help us resolve the issue quickly, please provide as much detail as possible:

* A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
* Any proof-of-concept, scripts, or screenshots that demonstrate the vulnerability.
* The version of the project you are using.

### Our Process

When you report a vulnerability, you can expect the following process:

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We will try to acknowledge receipt of your report within **3-5 business days**.
2.  **Investigation:** We will investigate the issue to confirm its validity. We may contact you for more information if needed.
3.  **Resolution:** If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a patch. Since this is a personal project, we cannot guarantee a specific timeline, but we will treat security issues with high priority.
4.  **Disclosure:** Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will release a new version and may publish a security advisory. We will credit you for your discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

### Bug Bounty

As this is a non-commercial, personal project, we do not offer a bug bounty program at this time. However, we are grateful for all contributions to the project's security and will happily provide public credit for your findings.
